I am a 5th-year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at Harvard University. My work focuses on developing and applying advanced statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and causal inference techniques to ensure fair and transparent evaluation of interventions and policies in public health, education, and business. 

I completed an internship with the Clinical Modeling & Evidence Integration team at [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.us/) (summer 2022). Before coming to Boston, I obtained my Master of Science in statistics from [University of Washington](https://stat.uw.edu/)(2020), where I worked with Prof. [Thomas Richardson](https://sites.stat.washington.edu/tsr/website/inquiry/home.php) on [coherent modelling of causal effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13687?casa_token=sf87P2ANuFsAAAAA:F3CLiuOaec35WR-65s_Mm65raXrEw6mMAd1rGEuCkHz5LAdtnJvZBsa9wPguhR2EQzSScs6RRL1lJg), Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Finance from National University of Singapore (2018).
