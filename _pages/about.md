Hi! I am a PhD student in Statistics at the [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), working with Prof. [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/). I am broadly interested in causal inference, reinforcement learning, and the practical side of the both. Previously, I have obtained my MS in statistics from [University of Washington](https://stat.uw.edu/)
