I am a PhD student in Statistics at the [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). I work with Prof. [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/) on assessing and improving algorithms to reduce burden in [micro-randomized trials](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/JITAI_MRT/mrts4.html) in mobile health studies.

I completed an internship with the Clinical Modeling & Evidence Integration team at [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.us/) (summer 2022). Before coming to Boston, I obtained my Master of Science in statistics from [University of Washington](https://stat.uw.edu/)(2020), where I worked with Prof. [Thomas Richardson](https://sites.stat.washington.edu/tsr/website/inquiry/home.php) on [coherent modelling of causal effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/biom.13687?casa_token=sf87P2ANuFsAAAAA:F3CLiuOaec35WR-65s_Mm65raXrEw6mMAd1rGEuCkHz5LAdtnJvZBsa9wPguhR2EQzSScs6RRL1lJg), Bachelor of Science in Quantitative Finance from National University of Singapore (2018). I have also completed a summer internship at [Dymon Asia Capital](https://www.dymonasia.com/) (2017).
